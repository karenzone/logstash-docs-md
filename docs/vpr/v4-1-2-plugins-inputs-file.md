## Description [_description]

Stream events from files, normally by tailing them in a manner similar to `tail -0F` but optionally reading them from the beginning.

Normally, logging will add a newline to the end of each line written. By default, each event is assumed to be one line and a line is taken to be the text before a newline character. If you would like to join multiple log lines into one event, you’ll want to use the multiline codec. The plugin loops between discovering new files and processing each discovered file. Discovered files have a lifecycle, they start off in the "watched" or "ignored" state. Other states in the lifecycle are: "active", "closed" and "unwatched"

By default, a window of 4095 files is used to limit the number of file handles in use. The processing phase has a number of stages:

* Checks whether "closed" or "ignored" files have changed in size since last time and if so puts them in the "watched" state.
* Selects enough "watched" files to fill the available space in the window, these files are made "active".
* The active files are opened and read, each file is read from the last known position to the end of current content (EOF) by default.

In some cases it is useful to be able to control which files are read first, sorting, and whether files are read completely or banded/striped. Complete reading is **all of** file A then file B then file C and so on. Banded or striped reading is **some of** file A then file B then file C and so on looping around to file A again until all files are read. Banded reading is specified by changing [`file_chunk_count`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_chunk_count) and perhaps [`file_chunk_size`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_chunk_size). Banding and sorting may be useful if you want some events from all files to appear in Kibana as early as possible.

The plugin has two modes of operation, Tail mode and Read mode.

### Tail mode [_tail_mode]

In this mode the plugin aims to track changing files and emit new content as it’s appended to each file. In this mode, files are seen as a never ending stream of content and EOF has no special significance. The plugin always assumes that there will be more content. When files are rotated, the smaller or zero size is detected, the current position is reset to zero and streaming continues. A delimiter must be seen before the accumulated characters can be emitted as a line.

### Read mode [_read_mode]

In this mode the plugin treats each file as if it is content complete, that is, a finite stream of lines and now EOF is significant. A last delimiter is not needed because EOF means that the accumulated characters can be emitted as a line. Further, EOF here means that the file can be closed and put in the "unwatched" state - this automatically frees up space in the active window. This mode also makes it possible to process compressed files as they are content complete. Read mode also allows for an action to take place after processing the file completely.

In the past attempts to simulate a Read mode while still assuming infinite streams was not ideal and a dedicated Read mode is an improvement.

## Reading from remote network volumes [_reading_from_remote_network_volumes]

The file input is not tested on remote filesystems such as NFS, Samba, s3fs-fuse, etc. These remote filesystems typically have behaviors that are very different from local filesystems and are therefore unlikely to work correctly when used with the file input.

## Tracking of current position in watched files [_tracking_of_current_position_in_watched_files]

The plugin keeps track of the current position in each file by recording it in a separate file named sincedb. This makes it possible to stop and restart Logstash and have it pick up where it left off without missing the lines that were added to the file while Logstash was stopped.

By default, the sincedb file is placed in the data directory of Logstash with a filename based on the filename patterns being watched (i.e. the `path` option). Thus, changing the filename patterns will result in a new sincedb file being used and any existing current position state will be lost. If you change your patterns with any frequency it might make sense to explicitly choose a sincedb path with the `sincedb_path` option.

A different `sincedb_path` must be used for each input. Using the same path will cause issues. The read checkpoints for each input must be stored in a different path so the information does not override.

Sincedb records can now be expired meaning that read positions of older files will not be remembered after a certain time period. File systems may need to reuse inodes for new content. Ideally, we would not use the read position of old content, but we have no reliable way to detect that inode reuse has occurred. This is more relevant to Read mode where a great many files are tracked in the sincedb. Bear in mind though, if a record has expired, a previously seen file will be read again.

Sincedb files are text files with four (< v5.0.0), five or six columns:

1. The inode number (or equivalent).
2. The major device number of the file system (or equivalent).
3. The minor device number of the file system (or equivalent).
4. The current byte offset within the file.
5. The last active timestamp (a floating point number)
6. The last known path that this record was matched to (for old sincedb records converted to the new format, this is blank.

On non-Windows systems you can obtain the inode number of a file with e.g. `ls -li`.

## File rotation in Tail mode [_file_rotation_in_tail_mode]

File rotation is detected and handled by this input, regardless of whether the file is rotated via a rename or a copy operation. To support programs that write to the rotated file for some time after the rotation has taken place, include both the original filename and the rotated filename (e.g. /var/log/syslog and /var/log/syslog.1) in the filename patterns to watch (the `path` option). Note that the rotated filename will be treated as a new file so if `start_position` is set to *beginning* the rotated file will be reprocessed.

With the default value of `start_position` (*end*) any messages written to the end of the file between the last read operation prior to the rotation and its reopening under the new name (an interval determined by the `stat_interval` and `discover_interval` options) will not get picked up.

Also see [Common options](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-common-options) for a list of options supported by all input plugins.

### `close_older` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-close_older]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* Default value is `3600`

The file input closes any files that were last read the specified timespan in seconds ago. This has different implications depending on if a file is being tailed or read. If tailing, and there is a large time gap in incoming data the file can be closed (allowing other files to be opened) but will be queued for reopening when new data is detected. If reading, the file will be closed after closed_older seconds from when the last bytes were read. This setting is retained for backward compatibility if you upgrade the plugin to 5.0.0+, are reading not tailing and do not switch to using Read mode.

### `delimiter` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-delimiter]

* Value type is [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string)
* Default value is `"\n"`

set the new line delimiter, defaults to "\n". Note that when reading compressed files this setting is not used, instead the standard Windows or Unix line endings are used.

### `discover_interval` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-discover_interval]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* Default value is `15`

How often (in seconds) we expand the filename patterns in the `path` option to discover new files to watch.

### `exclude` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-exclude]

* Value type is [array](/lsr/value-types.md#array)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Exclusions (matched against the filename, not full path). Filename patterns are valid here, too. For example, if you have

```
    path => "/var/log/*"
```

In Tail mode, you might want to exclude gzipped files:

```
    exclude => "*.gz"
```

### `file_chunk_count` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_chunk_count]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* Default value is `4611686018427387903`

When combined with the `file_chunk_size`, this option sets how many chunks (bands or stripes) are read from each file before moving to the next active file. For example, a `file_chunk_count` of 32 and a `file_chunk_size` 32KB will process the next 1MB from each active file. As the default is very large, the file is effectively read to EOF before moving to the next active file.

### `file_chunk_size` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_chunk_size]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* Default value is `32768` (32KB)

File content is read off disk in blocks or chunks and lines are extracted from the chunk. See [`file_chunk_count`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_chunk_count) to see why and when to change this setting from the default.

### `file_completed_action` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_completed_action]

* Value can be any of: `delete`, `log`, `log_and_delete`
* The default is `delete`.

When in `read` mode, what action should be carried out when a file is done with. If *delete* is specified then the file will be deleted. If *log* is specified then the full path of the file is logged to the file specified in the `file_completed_log_path` setting. If `log_and_delete` is specified then both above actions take place.

### `file_completed_log_path` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_completed_log_path]

* Value type is [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Which file should the completely read file paths be appended to. Only specify this path to a file when `file_completed_action` is *log* or *log_and_delete*. IMPORTANT: this file is appended to only - it could become very large. You are responsible for file rotation.

### `file_sort_by` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_sort_by]

* Value can be any of: `last_modified`, `path`
* The default is `last_modified`.

Which attribute of a "watched" file should be used to sort them by. Files can be sorted by modified date or full path alphabetic. Previously the processing order of the discovered and therefore "watched" files was OS dependent.

### `file_sort_direction` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-file_sort_direction]

* Value can be any of: `asc`, `desc`
* The default is `asc`.

Select between ascending and descending order when sorting "watched" files. If oldest data first is important then the defaults of `last_modified` + `asc` are good. If newest data first is more important then opt for `last_modified` + `desc`. If you use special naming conventions for the file full paths then perhaps `path` + `asc` will help to control the order of file processing.

### `ignore_older` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-ignore_older]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* There is no default value for this setting.

When the file input discovers a file that was last modified before the specified timespan in seconds, the file is ignored. After it’s discovery, if an ignored file is modified it is no longer ignored and any new data is read. By default, this option is disabled. Note this unit is in seconds.

### `max_open_files` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-max_open_files]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* There is no default value for this setting.

What is the maximum number of file_handles that this input consumes at any one time. Use close_older to close some files if you need to process more files than this number. This should not be set to the maximum the OS can do because file handles are needed for other LS plugins and OS processes. A default of 4095 is set in internally.

### `mode` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-mode]

* Value can be either `tail` or `read`.
* The default value is `tail`.

What mode do you want the file input to operate in. Tail a few files or read many content-complete files. Read mode now supports gzip file processing. If "read" is specified then the following other settings are ignored:

1. `start_position` (files are always read from the beginning)
2. `close_older` (files are automatically *closed* when EOF is reached)

If "read" is specified then the following settings are heeded:

1. `ignore_older` (older files are not processed)
2. `file_completed_action` (what action should be taken when the file is processed)
3. `file_completed_log_path` (which file should the completed file path be logged to)

### `path` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-path]

* This is a required setting.
* Value type is [array](/lsr/value-types.md#array)
* There is no default value for this setting.

The path(s) to the file(s) to use as an input. You can use filename patterns here, such as `/var/log/*.log`. If you use a pattern like `/var/log/**/*.log`, a recursive search of `/var/log` will be done for all `*.log` files. Paths must be absolute and cannot be relative.

You may also configure multiple paths. See an example on the [Logstash configuration page](/lsr/value-types.md#array).

### `sincedb_clean_after` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-sincedb_clean_after]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* The default value for this setting is 14.
* This unit is in **days** and can be decimal e.g. 0.5 is 12 hours.

The sincedb record now has a last active timestamp associated with it. If no changes are detected in a tracked file in the last N days its sincedb tracking record expires and will not be persisted. This option helps protect against the inode recycling problem. Filebeat has a [FAQ about inode recycling](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/faq.html).

### `sincedb_path` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-sincedb_path]

* Value type is [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Path of the sincedb database file (keeps track of the current position of monitored log files) that will be written to disk. The default will write sincedb files to `<path.data>/plugins/inputs/file` NOTE: it must be a file path and not a directory path

### `sincedb_write_interval` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-sincedb_write_interval]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* Default value is `15`

How often (in seconds) to write a since database with the current position of monitored log files.

### `start_position` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-start_position]

* Value can be any of: `beginning`, `end`
* Default value is `"end"`

Choose where Logstash starts initially reading files: at the beginning or at the end. The default behavior treats files like live streams and thus starts at the end. If you have old data you want to import, set this to *beginning*.

This option only modifies "first contact" situations where a file is new and not seen before, i.e. files that don’t have a current position recorded in a sincedb file read by Logstash. If a file has already been seen before, this option has no effect and the position recorded in the sincedb file will be used.

### `stat_interval` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-stat_interval]

* Value type is [number](/lsr/value-types.md#number)
* Default value is `1`

How often (in seconds) we stat files to see if they have been modified. Increasing this interval will decrease the number of system calls we make, but increase the time to detect new log lines.

## Common options [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-common-options]

These configuration options are supported by all input plugins:

| Setting | Input type | Required |
| :- | :- | :- |
| [`add_field`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-add_field) | [hash](/lsr/value-types.md#hash) | No |
| [`codec`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-codec) | [codec](/lsr/value-types.md#codec) | No |
| [`enable_metric`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-enable_metric) | [boolean](/lsr/value-types.md#boolean) | No |
| [`id`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-id) | [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string) | No |
| [`tags`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-tags) | [array](/lsr/value-types.md#array) | No |
| [`type`](v4-1-2-plugins-inputs-file.md#v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-type) | [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string) | No |

### `add_field` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-add_field]

* Value type is [hash](/lsr/value-types.md#hash)
* Default value is `{}`

Add a field to an event

### `codec` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-codec]

* Value type is [codec](/lsr/value-types.md#codec)
* Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for input data. Input codecs are a convenient method for decoding your data before it enters the input, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

### `enable_metric` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-enable_metric]

* Value type is [boolean](/lsr/value-types.md#boolean)
* Default value is `true`

Disable or enable metric logging for this specific plugin instance by default we record all the metrics we can, but you can disable metrics collection for a specific plugin.

### `id` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-id]

* Value type is [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Add a unique `ID` to the plugin configuration. If no ID is specified, Logstash will generate one. It is strongly recommended to set this ID in your configuration. This is particularly useful when you have two or more plugins of the same type, for example, if you have 2 file inputs. Adding a named ID in this case will help in monitoring Logstash when using the monitoring APIs.

```
input {
  file {
    id => "my_plugin_id"
  }
}
```

### `tags` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-tags]

* Value type is [array](/lsr/value-types.md#array)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Add any number of arbitrary tags to your event.

This can help with processing later.

### `type` [v4.1.2-plugins-inputs-file-type]

* Value type is [string](/lsr/value-types.md#string)
* There is no default value for this setting.

Add a `type` field to all events handled by this input.

Types are used mainly for filter activation.

The type is stored as part of the event itself, so you can also use the type to search for it in Kibana.

If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at the shipper stays with that event for its life even when sent to another Logstash server.
